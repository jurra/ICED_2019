## Case studies:
- [opencores](https://opencores.org/)
- [Maslow CNC]()
## Metodo
- Design in the large social context(Macro level)
- How design takes place as a collective (This is the first as is the context in which individual micro-decisions take place) (Meso level)
- How design takes place individually (This is a different level of activity analysis)(Micro Level)
- To narrow even more the research we can use the archetypes of Mozilla research and verify, build on top of that.
- Find out from Macro to Meso to Micro()
- Map community roles, and interaction between peers

> The unit of analysis in AT is the concept of object-oriented, collective and culturally mediated human activity, or activity system. This system includes the object (or objective), subject, mediating artifacts (signs and tools), rules, community and division of labor. [Read more..](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_theory)

Key components of activity system
> The original perspective, represented by the upper triangle in the diagram, was that human activity is performed by agents (subject) motivated toward solution of a problem or by a purpose (object or motive) mediated by tools (artifacts) within a transformational process yielding a result (outcome).

> The hierarchy of actions and the identification of the different components of an activity system provide helpful guideposts for articulating and examining the complexity of context.

**Hypothesis 1:** No mater the limitations, people will try to reach out and collaborate when they can and they want, using the internet.
**Hypothesis 2:** The easier it is to interact the on a peer to peer basis the richer the interactions will become then, and therefore more rules to collaborate come into place.


- Actividades estructurantes (Colectivas e individuales) These needs to be very much part of the conclusions.

Observations:
> users often feel daunted by the rapid pace of technological change, which makes it ever more difficult to become skilled with a given technology.[1]

> If we are acting with technology, both possibilities and responsibilities expand.[1]

Difference between using wikis, forums, git, etc.


# What to observe or map:
- Contradictions: managing the scale of participation, issues and discussions


## Assumptions:

1. Peer production has been taking place already for decades, firstly in software, lately in hardware(Example Reprap).
2. Although these collaborative and open processes are taking place the tools,methodologies and pacing in the domain of software, compared to the domain of things, is transforming faster.
3. Nevertheless there is a clear transfer of practices from the software culture ot the hardware culture, or the design of things.
4. Peer to Peer is already very advanced in software combining management at project level, in combination with community work, examples: Redhat, Gitlab, Linux.
5. The software industry is familiarized with the designerly way of thinking, in fact UX design, UX research, marketing, graphic design, are recognized as complementary domains within the software culture.
