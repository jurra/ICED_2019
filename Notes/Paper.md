ABSTRACT
Understanding the historical evolution and transformations of design activities is key to improve design theories and methodologies. Peer production activities and tools, have been shaping most of modern knowledge based activities like science and engineering. These new collective processes are enabled by the new collaborative possibilities afforded by the internet. The first and most consolidated examples come from Free and open source software, eventually spreading in the hardware domain (open hardware). There is an evident and evolving transfer or these peer to peer practices, which are widely used and standard in software, into other domains. Examples of such domains are hardware design and engineering design. In this paper we study how open source peer production practices are being adopted in the design of tangible products, what specific difficulties related to hardware arise within this transfer and how it could evolve.

# INTRODUCTION
> Recently, the philosophy and principles of open-source software have begun to be applied to the design and production of physical products. This practice of open- source hardware involves sharing the original design files for an object in a way that allows it to be modified or reproduced by others, including for commercial use. The recently drafted open-source hardware statement of principles [6] explains it this way: "Open source hardware is hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design.” Open-source hardware has been perhaps most-widely adopted in the domain of electronic circuits, both by producers of do-it- yourself kits (e.g. Adafruit Industries) and of mass- manufactured devices (e.g. Chumby).


## Highlights of the open source phenomenon

The free-software movement started in 1983, when the GNU Project and operating system was launched to the public [R]. The aim of the project was to revive the spirit of cooperation among hackers during the early days of computing. In more practical terms these motivations were articulated by defining four essential freedoms(requirements) that any program source code must respect:
> The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this. [13]

This movement initiated an unprecedented and unexpected phenomenon in the history of technology development, and **the way systems are designed**. The first characteristic of this process is that radical technology innovations can come also from the public domain, and it is not anymore exclusive of companies and corporations. In contrast to traditional industries, it has developed and grown by nurturing collaboration, standardization and freedom of choice, in contrast with traditional competitive practices like differentiation,the enforcement of intellectual assets like patents, among others. Another major change is the principle of keeping the technology know-how opened allowing anyone to practice the 4 freedoms described previously. The third one and perhaps the most surprising is that these open approach has radically scaled and proved to be more productive compared to the closed source traditional paths.



> These companies publish schematics and layout files for circuit boards and computer-aided design (CAD) files for enclosures or other mechanical parts. Others can study and modify these designs to create their own versions of a product or to contribute improvements back to the original manufacturer.
We see these activities as a form of distributed collaboration, enabled by the internet and by the increasing accessibility of fabrication technology. This paper explores the nature of such open-source hardware collaboration through a prominent example, the Arduino microcontroller development platform. Here, we examine the nine variations on the Arduino Duemilanove (an electronic circuit board) that were included a comprehensive list published in 2009 by Make Magazine [8]. By reviewing online information about these variations and through present-day interviews with their developers, we form a model of open-source hardware collaboration. We find that its structure differs substantially from that of open-source software, emphasizing multiple alternatives from small- scale partnerships rather than centralized public processes. In this work, we are drawing partly on our own experience as developers of Arduino and of one of the variations discussed here (the LilyPad Arduino).

### The economic and social impact of open source
Source control management system: key criterion, distributed,
Git is a response to the problems that have developed within open source teams, and concurrent collaboration.... Network of trust, another important concept (Linux).Centralized problems, disruption in this sense, user centered design, or lead user (Linus)

### Transfer of open source practices, culture and tools to the hardware domain

## Research Questions:
### General questions:
- What patterns can be found in the transfer of open source culture, practices and tools from the software to the hardware context?
- How is the peer to peer and collaboration processes taking place in the projects selected for the case studies?

## Methodology

### Materials
- Interviews and talks from founders of free software and open source movement.
- Forums of different projects like reprap,
### Design
Criterion for case selection:
- The Authors familiarity with certain open source projects.
- The availability of data like discussions, documentation, and resources to pursue this study.
- Case study of diverse open source software and hardware projects with different characteristics:
We selected projects that present basic similarities with regard to basic freedoms mentioned in the previous section:
- For both sets of cases there is considerable difference in scope, product architecture, documentation, participation,tools but also in age. These set allows us to verify how time reflects in project maturity, adoption of modern practices, but also consistencies regardless of these differences.
- For the software projects there is a main similarity: they all use git based peer review tools.

#### Theoretical framework to guide our research: Activity theory
Talk briefly about why this framework, Larry Cosntantine, Gay,

### Procedure
The two sets of cases (three for software, and three for hardware) are analyzed independently with respect to their own differences and similarities considering:
- What is the main object of their activity
- What is the main outcome(s) or product(s) of such activity
- What rules and tools they use to organize their collaboration
- What interesting aspects stand out in the case with regard to the outcomes, motivations, expectations as well as the collaboration process.

Later on key differences and similarities between the two sets are described and discussed considering also the same questions points.


## Results
### Git: the most widely used version control System in the world  
#### Object: A distributed

## Differences and similarities among open source software projects


## Differences and similarities among open source hardware projects


## Differences and similarities among the sets of open source software  and open source hardware projects 

#### Interesting aspects:
-  It was created by a lead user in this context[]. In this case linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux after struggling with control version systems at the moment:"Quote "

## Conclusions
These complex collaboration tools and technologies, like git reflect, or embed values, motivations and principles. Git is an example where distributed work, open source principles, are reflected or implemented in the tool itself. Therefore the tools, shape, potentiate and enable certain developments.
- The way the community organizes and leverage collective potential is what matters. Some tools facilitate these
- Lead users innovators, resonates with the concept of design expertise by Cross.
