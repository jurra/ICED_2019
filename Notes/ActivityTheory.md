Activity theory is most often used to describe actions in a socio-technical system through six related elements (Bryant et al. as defined by Leonti'ev 1981 and redefined in Engeström 1987) of a conceptual system expanded by more nuanced theories:

**Object-orientedness** – the objective of the activity system. Object refers to the objectiveness of the reality; items are considered objective according to natural sciences but also have social and cultural properties.
**Subject or internalization** – actors engaged in the activities; the traditional notion of mental processes
**Community or externalization** – social context; all actors involved in the activity system
**Tools or tool mediation** – the artifacts (or concepts) used by actors in the system. Tools influence actor-structure interactions, they change with accumulating experience. In addition to physical shape, the knowledge also evolves. Tools are influenced by culture, and their use is a way for the accumulation and transmission of social knowledge. Tools influence both the agents and the structure.
**Division of labor** – social strata, hierarchical structure of activity, the division of activities among actors in the system
**Rules** – conventions, guidelines and rules regulating activities in the system
