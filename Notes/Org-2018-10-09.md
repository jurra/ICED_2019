#FOLLOWUP: Meeting with Petra about paper
- [ ] Start mapping key moments for gitlab repositories.
How to do it?
* Look into the git tree and commits documentation.
* Look into Project boards
* Look into roles

- [ ] Analyze RepRap Later.


#DOING: Plan Research tasks break it down as a backlog
Empirical domain, observables:
* Commits, roles, Merge requests, time
* [Commit tree](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/network/master).
* Backlog(TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE).

Inference and understanding:
* Negotiation


Collaboration aided by design (Interesting inference)
Decision Gitlab is a good case study because there is a lot of data to analyze how people work and decide.

## Interesting observations
Tight control on file management and contribution guidelines due to technical constrains with binary files.(These is a difference with software)

**Hypothesis 1:** No mater the limitations, people will try to reach out and collaborate when they can and they want, using the internet.
**Hypothesis 2:** The easier it is to interact the on a peer to peer basis the richer the interactions will become then, and therefore more rules to collaborate come into place.



Today we were rejected by SDGP fund. Mistake in application.

#DONE: SDGP Cuba Misunderstanding
I actually called and asked if Cuba was on the list
