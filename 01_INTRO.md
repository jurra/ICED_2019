# INTRODUCTION
> Recently, the philosophy and principles of open-source software have begun to be applied to the design and production of physical products. This practice of open- source hardware involves sharing the original design files for an object in a way that allows it to be modified or reproduced by others, including for commercial use. The recently drafted open-source hardware statement of principles [6] explains it this way: "Open source hardware is hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design.” Open-source hardware has been perhaps most-widely adopted in the domain of electronic circuits, both by producers of do-it- yourself kits (e.g. Adafruit Industries) and of mass- manufactured devices (e.g. Chumby).


## Highlights of the open source phenomenon

The free-software movement started in 1983, when the GNU Project and operating system was launched to the public [R]. The aim of the project was to revive the spirit of cooperation among hackers during the early days of computing. In more practical terms these motivations were articulated by defining four essential freedoms(requirements) that any program source code must respect:
> The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this. [13]

This movement initiated an unprecedented and unexpected phenomenon in the history of technology development, and **the way systems are designed**. The first characteristic of this process is that radical technology innovations can come also from the public domain, and it is not anymore exclusive of companies and corporations. In contrast to traditional industries, it has developed and grown by nurturing collaboration, standardization and freedom of choice, in contrast with traditional competitive practices like differentiation,the enforcement of intellectual assets like patents, among others. Another major change is the principle of keeping the technology know-how opened allowing anyone to practice the 4 freedoms described previously. The third one and perhaps the most surprising is that these open approach has radically scaled and proved to be more productive compared to the closed source traditional paths.

> These companies publish schematics and layout files for circuit boards and computer-aided design (CAD) files for enclosures or other mechanical parts. Others can study and modify these designs to create their own versions of a product or to contribute improvements back to the original manufacturer.
We see these activities as a form of distributed collaboration, enabled by the internet and by the increasing accessibility of fabrication technology. This paper explores the nature of such open-source hardware collaboration through a prominent example, the Arduino microcontroller development platform. Here, we examine the nine variations on the Arduino Duemilanove (an electronic circuit board) that were included a comprehensive list published in 2009 by Make Magazine [8]. By reviewing online information about these variations and through present-day interviews with their developers, we form a model of open-source hardware collaboration. We find that its structure differs substantially from that of open-source software, emphasizing multiple alternatives from small- scale partnerships rather than centralized public processes. In this work, we are drawing partly on our own experience as developers of Arduino and of one of the variations discussed here (the LilyPad Arduino).

### The economic and social impact of open source
Source control management system: key criterion, distributed,
Git is a response to the problems that have developed within open source teams, and concurrent collaboration.... Network of trust, another important concept (Linux).Centralized problems, disruption in this sense, user centered design, or lead user (Linus)

## Research Questions:
### General questions:
- What patterns can be found in the transfer of open source culture, practices and tools from the software to the hardware context?
- How is the peer to peer and collaboration processes taking place in the projects selected for the case studies?
