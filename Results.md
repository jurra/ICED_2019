Different Activity Objects:
- Research and Development
- Design and Production
- Replication

General
[RepRap Community Resources](https://reprap.org/wiki/Category:Development)


Releases:
[Iteration 2 Prusa Mendel](https://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel)
[Iteration 3 Prousa](https://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3)
- Look at the variants, metal sheet, or box frame

#DATA: ### Example of I2C issues in Opencores
- [I2C Issue](https://opencores.org/forum/Cores/0/990)

#DATA: ### Tools used in Arduino
- Uses github for development of firmware

#DATA: ### About version control in Arduino in forum
- [About version control discussion in Arduino Community](https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=147.0)

##DATA: ### Linux contribution guidelines:
- [Git contribution guideline](https://github.com/git/git)
- [Submmiting patches Linux](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches). This is what is important


## Research Objectives
This work aims to understand the adoption of open source practices originally coming from software, into other design domains.
- Other interesting questions can be verifying main design theory topics like what Cross call for design expertise..


## Possible titles:
1. Understanding Open Source Design Through the Lens of Activity theory





## Main concepts about open source
-BOM; CAM files;


## About methods
In all this communities there are direct contact between users and producers, there are prosumers, as well as core teams.


## Software
### Git
- Division of labor
- Object of Activity
- Outcome

### Atom



### Arduino IDE (The software side of Arduino)
- Division of labor


## Hardware

### Reprap
Basic profile:
- How it started

- Tools:

### Arduino


### Beagleboard
Only two issues started very recently. Lots of forks meaning that people are interested in the repository. Good documentation with BOM
- **division of labor**: no clear division of labor, delegation or participation

### Maslow
Repository

Conclusions:
- Essential tools, differences and similarities

Add to the conclusions my learning about the difference between

## 11-5-2018
- Segmented cultural transfer:
  - Open Source collaborative practices and culture
  - Devops, scrum like practices


- Pattern of problem solving: One person takes a problem, or a problem is solved with different people (This is the division of labour pattern)(Dominant pattern), this has to do with system architecture and modularity

## Commonalities found
- Main activities or workflow: Access to resources, identified shared problem, recognized problem, shared solution and feedback, review and quality assurance, publish


## Projects studied
- Arduino p2p tools (software side IDE):  git, mail list,
    - No collaboration for the hardware side of it just the source files

- Reprap p2p tools: wiki, forum
  - Collaboration in hardware and software

- Git p2p tools: git, mail list,
- Linux p2p tools: git, mail list
- Gitlab p2p tools: gitlab (devops approach)

- Open Source Ecology uses a wiki (There are no contribution guidelines)



## Identified problems for p2p design in the world of things
- Releasing the source and documenting how to use the source is not a problem
- Finding version control is still a problem in some scenarios


## Observations:
- Git version control system it is being used currently in RepRap project. There is some redundancy in Documentation, as in the wiki also in development there is also documentation.
- In a peer to peer kind of activity where is an exchange or a service, there is normally an exchange, where someone needs to solve a problem, or has a need, and another one provides with the solutions, or attempts so. Looking it considering the Activity Framework, p2p we have someone that asks for something, someone that provides something.
- Loose p2p exchange vs tight direct p2p exchange. Loose p2p exchange normally takes place via artifacts, the artifacts them self guide the user in realizing the goals and actions that are necessary. Tight or direct p2p exchange takes place between one or more users in a chat, conference call, or direct contact, in person.
