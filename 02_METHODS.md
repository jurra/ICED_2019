## Methodology

### Materials
- Interviews and talks from founders of free software and open source movement.
- Forums of different projects like reprap,
### Design
Criterion for case selection:
- The Authors familiarity with certain open source projects.
- The availability of data like discussions, documentation, and resources to pursue this study.
- Case study of diverse open source software and hardware projects with different characteristics:
We selected projects that present basic similarities with regard to basic freedoms mentioned in the previous section:
- For both sets of cases there is considerable difference in scope, product architecture, documentation, participation,tools but also in age. These set allows us to verify how time reflects in project maturity, adoption of modern practices, but also consistencies regardless of these differences.
- For the software projects there is a main similarity: they all use git based peer review tools.

#### Theoretical framework to guide our research: Activity theory
Talk briefly about why this framework, Larry Cosntantine, Gay,

### Procedure
The two sets of cases (three for software, and three for hardware) are analyzed independently with respect to their own differences and similarities considering:
- What is the main object of their activity
- What is the main outcome(s) or product(s) of such activity
- What rules and tools they use to organize their collaboration
- What interesting aspects stand out in the case with regard to the outcomes, motivations, expectations as well as the collaboration process.

Later on key differences and similarities between the two sets are described and discussed considering also the same questions points.
