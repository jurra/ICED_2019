## Methodology
This work attempts to capture significant aspects of the context of open source projects. To map these contexts we use Activity Theory framework[REFERENCE]. This framework allowed us to capture patterns of behavior and collaborative dynamics similarities and differences, beyond the specificities of what tools or systems are used, how tools reflect intagible aspects of socio-technical systems like values, motivations, community rules as well as roles within collaborative dynamics.
#### Brief introduction to Activity Theory
This research uses the expanded Activity Theory framework developed by Engestrom [REFERENCE]. This framework provides a consistent model to analyze collective processes like product design and development as part of a social context. This approach considers tools and procedures as part of a broader set of human interactions.
#### Design

- The Authors familiarity with certain open source projects.
- The availability of data like discussions, documentation, and resources to pursue this study.

The two sets of cases (three for software, and three for hardware) are analyzed independently with respect to their own differences and similarities considering the different components of the Activity System model.
- What is the main object of the activity
- What is the main outcome(s) or product(s) of such activity
- What rules and tools they use to organize their collaboration
- What interesting aspects stand out in the case with regard to the outcomes, motivations, expectations as well as the collaboration process.

- Case study of diverse open source software and hardware projects with different characteristics:
We selected projects that present basic similarities with regard to basic freedoms mentioned in the previous section:
- For both sets of cases there is considerable difference in scope, product architecture, documentation, participation,tools but also in age. These set allows us to verify how time reflects in project maturity, adoption of modern practices, but also consistencies regardless of these differences.
- For the software projects there is a main similarity: they all use git based peer review tools.

### Materials
- Interviews and talks from founders of free software and open source movement.
- Forums of different projects like RepRap.
- Project and product documentation

### Procedure


Later on key differences and similarities between the two sets are described and discussed considering also the same questions points.
