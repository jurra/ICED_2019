## Results
In this section we expose some prominent characteristics of the peer to peer interactions using the Activity Theory framework. We study at a very general level how peer to peer requirements are reflect in the artifacts, object, subject, community, rules and

[//]:# (Open peer to peer collaborative work (No control on peers but only on the process)

#### Essential peer to peer artifacts
From an Activity Theory stand point we can identify many artifacts within open source projects based on the different processes that take place. Mapping out all these artifacts is beyond the scope of this work. Nevertheless there are specific artifacts that are essential to enable an open and horizontal peer to peer collaborative process:
- **License** which describes in legal terms what can and cannot be done with the source code ranging from ethical issues to commercial and distribution issues.[Refer to the GPL license].Since the FREE Software licenses were created, every open source project has adopted licenses.

- **Means to publish their work:** Wikis and git repositories..
- **Contributing guidelines**
- **Product documentation***
- **Peer review tools**

### The Object and the subject in peer to peer: user led projects
An interesting phenomenon in the projects we have studied is that all their founders and main collaborators have been at certain point users with particular needs and capacities to improve their products they have been using. Furthermore they have become contributors, developers and entrepeneurs within their communities, becoming expert developers, profesionals and community leaders. For instance Linus Torvalds developed the Linux Kernel partly because he needed, partly because he enjoued programming, he says that he never imagined Linux would evolve into what it is today. Richard Stallman the father of the FREE/Software movement and the GNU/Linux Project, refused to accept that computer scientists, programmers and users in general were not able to do study the source code.
Josef Prusa, a main contributor in the RepRap community explains in an interview:
>  originally got into 3D printing because I was into music, and I started to build my own MIDI controllers. I needed all sorts of little knobs and faders. So that’s how I found 3D printing. I started to build one myself, but it took so much time and so many parts that I eventually started to make it simpler. I started to improve it and give back, and so that’s how the Prusa Simplified Mendel came to the world.

Open Source Ecology was also motivated by a set of conflicts that Marcin Jakubowski experienced after starting a farm. He was frustrated with the fact that he had to pay a lot of money and invest a lot without good results:
> I bought a tractor then it broke, I paid to get it repaired, then it broke again....I realized that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm....just didn't exist.

In the case of Git and Gitlab the original motivation was again to solve problems meeting specific requirements.


At a certain moment he felt it was worth sharing it, or releasing and he chose an open source license (artifact), to avoid dealing with others wanting to take advantage of his work.


> Teensy by PJRC – Paul has contributed a lot of code, bug reports, pull requests and to the discourse in general.
Flora by Adafruit – Limor has contributed over 100 libraries and countless tutorials about Arduino becoming one of the most important members of the Arduino ecosystem.

#### The "expansion" of the object, new possibilities and paths within communities
Linux is actually part of a bigger project also known as the GNU/Linux project. Linux is a very important component in the operating system and it can be understood in this context as an extension, or important completion of the GNU project started by Richard Stallman.

The GNU project, as well as the licenses proposed by Stallman have developed towards what he called a free operating system which developments belongs to the public domain and is led by a open collaborative communities. This is again a particular vision (object) on the type of product he needed.  

> I did not started Linux as a collaborative project, I started it as one in a series of many projects I had done at the time for myself, partly because I needed the end result, but even more because I just
enjoyed programming...and there was no open source, really, on my radar at all.

Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Kernel component of the GNU/Linux operating system had very personal motivations when he started developing the kernel:
> I started it as one in a series of many projects I had done at the time for myself, partly because I needed the end result, but even more because I just enjoyed programming.


#### The "expansion" of the subject in peer to peer Activity Systems
**Community composition the pyramid of users**
- [ ] Here I talk about community of users, user groups examples...


**Division of labor** users producers are kings




#### The unexpectedness of the positive outcomes vs expected negative outcomes
[//]:# (It is actually the inverse narrative, I started looking at the outcomes, of the activity system, and from there on reached to the results above)
**Consistent evolution of versions and variants:**
Each of the open source projects document the different version releases which represent new iterations and developments on the open source product. Releases are announced very often before the actual release discussing the main improvements that will take place. It was found that some projects like Linux, Arduino, ReRap and Open Source Ecology products are also distributed by other peer entities with different purposes and objectives. Many of these distributions are variants with their own versions (improvements) over time.

On the other hand it has been found that git and Gitlab are do not have at the moment variant releases and distributions, but instead version releases.

In the case of Linux, for instance there are literally hundreds of distributions (variants), which reflects a variety of releases, contributions, and motivations within the community. Examples of popular Linux distributions include Android, the most widely used operating system for mobile phones(%), Ubuntu for desktop and server operating system(#users, #market share), Debian([]) In the case of Arduino, there at least 15 official boards distributed by Arduino company, each of them with diversity of features and sizes. RepRap also shows the same pattern of evolution like Linux, Arduino,

Besides these there are third party distributions including "clones", "derivatives and counterfeits".
In open hardware "clones" refer to distributors that basically replicate the product based on the open source available, and benefit without clear contribution to the community


#### Community composition:
In all the projects except Open Source Ecology, there has been a sustained increase of participants and users adopting the open source products released. For instance Linux started as part of a very small group of hackers and computer scientists in 1992,....




Successful initiatives have provided many degrees of freedoms with regard to how to use and ....., distribute and , and participants, it allows others to reuse
